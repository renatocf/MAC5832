Error and Noise
================

- We have a target function `f`, unknown
  - Untill the last class, `y = f(x)`
  - From now on, we will have `P(y|x)` (probability of a given label from a
    feature).
  - `(x,y)` is generated by a joint distribution `P(x,y) = P(y|x)*P(x)`.

- A deterministic target is a special case of a noisy target:
  `P(y|x)` is zero except in `y = f(x)`.
