SVM (Support Vector Machine)
=============================

- The problem: separate two linearly separable classes in two groups by a
  hyperplane

- Given vector `v ∈ ℝ^d` and bias `a ∈ ℝ`
  Hyperplane as a function `h`:
  ```
  h: ℝ^d ---> ℝ
      x  |--> h(x) = v^Tx + a
  ```

- **Hyperplane as a border** in ℝ^d (and an implicit function)
  ∇(v,a) = { x ∈ ℝ^d | v^Tx + a = 0 }

- This is not the problem we want to solve:
  `{(x_i,y_i; i=1 : n}` a training sample, i.i.d. drawn accordingly to IP(x,y),
  unknown

- We want to be able to classify **new** observations: minimize IP(error)

- Looking for an universal approach
